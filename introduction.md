Why algorithms?
===============

Solves problems that could otherwise not be addressed.

Algorithms are the poetry of computation...
Algorithms have to be seen to be believed...
Bad programmers worry about the code, good programmers worry about data
structures...
Algorithms + Data Structurer = Algorithms

Algorithmic models are replacing mathematical models in science

There is no good reason not to study algorithms
